    <h1>Digit Converter Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: July 25, 2023</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing Digit Converter. Protecting your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we collect, use, and disclose information from you when you use our mobile application (the “Digit Converter”).</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>We do not collect any personal information from you when you use Digit Converter. The App does not require any
        user registration or account creation.</p>

    <p>The only information we collect is anonymous analytics data to help us understand usage patterns and improve the
        App. This may include information like the features used, session length, devices and operating systems used,
        and approximate location at the city level. No personal data is collected.</p>

    <h2>Use of Information</h2>

    <p>The analytics information we collect is used to improve the App, prioritize new features, and debug issues. We
        may use aggregate statistics about usage patterns in marketing materials and to demonstrate popularity of the
        App. The data is anonymized and no personal information is identifiable.</p>

    <h2>Information Disclosure</h2>

    <p>We do not disclose any information collected from the App to third parties. The limited analytics data is
        maintained internally and no personal identifiers are attached.</p>

    <p>If required by law, we may disclose information to comply with a legal requirement like a subpoena, court order,
        or search warrant. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users before complying unless we are legally
        restricted.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We only retain anonymous analytics data for as long as is useful to maintain and improve the App, typically 12
        months. Information is then disposed securely. We do not retain personal data since none is collected.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>The App is not targeted to or intended for use by children. We do not knowingly collect information from children
        under 13. If we become aware that a child has provided information without consent, we will delete it as soon as
        possible.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Policy</h2>

    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect changes in our App. We encourage you to
        review the policy periodically for any updates. Changes become effective immediately upon posting the revised
        Privacy Policy in the App.</p>
